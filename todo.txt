Roadmap
Web->App(react native)->Testing->Security

----------------------------------------

Config sign in with google
Freemium/Premium
error page
soft delete
register company verification (can upload products but is not seen by users and cant make movements)

Add alert to top menu (add model alert)

Show COMMENTS modal after transaction OK

client/id   - plan -> add tag
            - /transaction/id create
            - /product/id create

[user] companies/slug tarjeta -> 
        - add some stats and history?
        - Opiniontes -> add fomr
        - add opinion an valoration by transaction

user/id 
        - plan -> add tag

home
        - add recomendados and nuevos sliders

----------------------------------------

Bubble or FlutterFlow for no-code simple projects

Aqcuire for selling projects

NextJs to react native -> Capacitor, Apache Cordova, Tauri, PWA builder, Solito

PWA (manifest) + Native Shell (Capacitor, Apache Cordova, Tauri)

deployment fees on stores + should bypass payments inside to avoid % for users (send payments outside the app)

lighthouse to analyze site

1st - PWA
2nd - React Native Webview (not a bad idea, is a frame for showing web in a app format)
3rd - Capacitor

WebView to auth, then show hybrid site

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-nextjs-pwa/

Building a PWA and then using https://www.pwabuilder.com/ to make mobile apps displaying that PWA (I've successfully gotten apps like this into the app and play store, so ignore the online comments saying that they will be declined)
Difficulty: Easy (but hard to access some native-only features)

----------------------------------------

IDEAS:

* CONSTRUCTION: Simple sheets to PDF construction. A table that is linked to a PDF (or image) and mark down the (avance) of the project. Date, state, type, resources, etc... with colors by month
