NextJs to react native -> Capacitor, Apache Cordova, Tauri, PWA builder, Solito

PWA (manifest) + Native Shell (Capacitor, Apache Cordova, Tauri)

deployment fees on stores + should bypass payments inside to avoid % for users (send payments outside the app)

1st - Capacitor
2nd - PWA

IDEAS:

* CONSTRUCTION: Simple sheets to PDF construction. A table that is linked to a PDF (or image) and mark down the (avance) of the project. Date, state, type, resources, etc... with colors by month
